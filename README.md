# Data Publication <img src="https://www.ala.org.au/app/uploads/2020/06/ALA_Logo_Stacked_RGB.png" alt="ALA Logo" align="right" width="150px"/>

To publish a dataset with the ALA, please format your data as a Darwin Core Archive, which is a zipped folder containing both data and metadata. For information on how to build data in this format, see [the galaxias R package](https://galaxias.ala.org.au) or [our help file on how to share a dataset with the ALA](https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000261427-sharing-a-dataset-with-the-ala).

You can upload your dataset to the ALA by [filing an issue](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/data-publication/issues/new?template=new-dataset.md) within this repository and attaching your zip file to that issue. If you'd rather not use GitHub, you can [email us](mailto:support@ala.org.au) instead. If your dataset is over 100MB, you should upload your zipped dataset somewhere stable - such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [OSF](https://osf.io) - and send us the link using either of the suggested methods.

Once we receive your publication request, we'll check out your dataset using the [GBIF data validation service](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81281/gbif-data-validator). If it passes automated and manual checks, we'll respond saying we'll put it on our system. If it doesn't, we'll give further information on the issues we've identified.

## Why publish data through the ALA?

There are several benefits to publishing data via ALA:

-   Contribute to national and international biodiversity research
-   Support knowledge and conservation of Australian species
-   Give greater visibility and longevity to your data
-   Gain a [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) DOI that you can cite in your work

## What issues should I consider before publishing?

Please ensure that:

-   You have all the necessary rights to publish this dataset in its supplied form.
-   All relevant ethics processes have been followed in the collection of this data.
-   You have considered whether this dataset might reveal the locations of threatened, vulnerable or at-risk species and have taken steps to obfuscate that information.

Your metadata statement should contain:

-   Your name and contact details as the person responsible for this dataset.
-   The names of relevant funders, co-authors or collaborators.
-   The name and address of your host institution (submissions from private individuals are not supported by GBIF or its partner nodes).
-   A licence for your dataset (e.g. [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).
-   Links or reference numbers for relevant permits and approvals documents.
