**Drag and drop your Darwin Core Archive here to submit it to the ALA**

*Note this approach will only work for files that are 100 MB or less. If your data are larger than this, place it somewhere stable - such as a [GitHub release](https://github.com), or on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [OSF](https://osf.io) - and paste the link here instead.*

We'll check out your dataset and get back to you shortly.

Please place any comments regarding your submission in this box. You can delete this text if you'd like :)
